Team Name: “Lumberjacks” (Members: Mustafa Gureltol, Damon Llopiz, Hue Truong, Ashwin Gowda)

Application Name: “Lancer”

Innovative Idea:

The application we’ve decided to build combines elements of job sites, donation pages, and job request sites (such as Fiverr) for freelancers or those looking for specific projects to get involved in. It differs from other job sites in that it provides more transparency and freedom-of-choice for both companies and potential employees by displaying specific projects or products that are being worked on and allowing those who are interested to apply and/or donate/invest all from one website. Companies can choose to make details about their projects private or public, and can create donation tiers for those who simply want to support the project financially. Potential employees will have a wide variety of different company projects displayed to them, which they can apply for directly on the website by creating an account and uploading a portfolio/resume/etc. This is meant to be catered to those in more technical fields such as programming, but realistically can support jobs/projects from a wide variety of fields and trades.

Important Components: 

(Home page, user profile, company profile, company project board(s), open job positions board/application form, donations/investments/Pre-Order)

The first page that appears when a user accesses the website consists of “trending”, “new”, and “for you” sections users can browse. Each project on display will have the company names, skill requirements, and potentially a roadmap (depending on whether or not there’s an NDA required to view the details). User profile consists of a user’s name/bio, image, contact information, interests, and work experience. Company profile includes name, image, bio, the projects that the company is working on, detailed breakdown of each project along with their milestones, and a separate section for donations/investments/pre-orders. There will also be an application section next to the company’s projects that will allow a user to submit their application for a specific project or product.
