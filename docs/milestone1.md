Part 0: Data Interactions

We have made a few minor changes in user to data interaction since Milestone 0. Here is an updated list of data interactions:

* First user interaction is with the home page, where they will see our logo, a navigation bar at the top, and two different sections with trending projects and companies. Depending on if the user is logged in, they will see a "For You" section in place of the "Trending Companies" section.

* Upon clicking a project, users will be greeted with a project page containing a description, requirements, and an option to apply for the job.

* Clicking apply will bring the user to another page where they can upload a portfolio, resume, and/or cover letter, as well as a text box for additional details and/or why they would like to be hired for this project. Upon completion, users will be given a confirmation and redirected to the homepage.

* Upon clicking a company name, users will be directed to a comapny page showing past projects, current projects, and a link to their website, with additional contact details.

* Looking to the navbar, users clicking "Jobs" will see an expanded version of the home page sections, with jobs seperated categorically (by field, such as tech, literature, data analytics, etc).

* "Companies" will have a list of projects seperated by company, once again similar to the home page and job page.

* The "About" page will contain a brief description of what Lancer is and information about us developers.

* "Contact Us" will contain the email addresses of us developers, and a section to request features or report bugs.

* If logged in, the user profile page will contain projects the user has applied for, projects that have been accepted/completed, and previous work experience. Only the user themselves and companies will be able to view these contents.
